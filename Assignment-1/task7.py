# 7. Functions and Methods
# 1) Write a Python program to print "Hello" using a string.

s = "Hello"
print(s)



# 2) Write a Python program to allocate a string to a variable and print it
# Allocate a string to a variable
message = "Hello, Python programming!"

# Print the string
print(message)


# 3) Write a Python program to print a string using triple quotes
# Using triple double quotes
message = """This is a string
written using triple quotes.
It can span multiple lines."""

print(message)



# 4) Write a Python program to access the first character of a string using
# Define a string
text = "Python"

# Access and print the first character using indexing
n = text[0]

print("The first character is:", n)


# 5) Write a Python program to access the string from the second position onwards using slicing.
# Define a string
text = "Python Programming"

# Slice from the second character onward (index 1)
result = text[1:]

# Print the result
print("String from second position onwards:", result)


# 6) Write a Python program to access a string up to the fifth character
# Define a string
text = "Python Programming"

# Slice up to the fifth character (index 0 to 4)
result = text[:5]

# Print the result
print("String up to the fifth character:", result)


# 7) Write a Python program to print the substring between index values 1 and 4.
# Define a string
text = "Python Programming"

# Get substring from index 1 to 3 (4 is excluded)
n = text[1:4]

# Print the result
print("Substring from index 1 to 4 is:", n)


# 8) Write a Python program to print a string from the last character
# Define a string
text = "Python Programming"

# Access the last character using negative index
l_char = text[-1]

# Print the last character
print("The last character is:", l_char)


# 9) Write a Python program to print every alternate character from the string starting from index 1
# Define a string
text = "Python Programming"
result = text[1::2]

# Print the result
print("Alternate characters from index 1:", result)
